Database schema
###############

The ATF15xx chip database is the ultimate artefact produced by Project Bureau. Most importantly, it assigns a symbolic name to each known fuse or group of fuses and a symbolic value to each known pattern these fuses can take. Aside from that, it establishes relationships between basic elements: macrocells and logic blocks, macrocells and pins, pads and special functions.

The canonical form of the chip database distributed by the project is its `JSON serialization <database/database.json.gz>`_. A machine-readable `JSON schema <database/schema.json>`_ that describes the chip database structure is also available. The rest of this document contains a human-readable description of the chip database format.

General structure
=================

The chip database contains two kinds of entries: nodes and leaves. A *node* is a container (object or array) that may include other nodes and leaves. A *leaf* is an arbitrary data structure describing a feature of the device, e.g. the location of a fuse in a JED file plus its symbolic description. The chip database only uses a small amount of different leaf structures, which are described below.

.. _leaf-reference:

Reference leaf
--------------

Example: ``"M0"``.

The reference leaf links a single node to the node it's in. It is a string containing the name of the linked node.

Sequence leaf
-------------

Example: ``["MC1", "MC2"]``.

The sequence leaf links an ordered set of nodes to the node it's in. It is an array of :ref:`references <leaf-reference>`.

Mapping leaf
------------

Example: ``{"M1": "42", "M2": "43"}``.

The mapping leaf describes a one-to-one correspondence between nodes. It is an object containing :ref:`references <leaf-reference>` where the keys are also :ref:`references <leaf-reference>`.

Range leaf
----------

Example: ``[100, 200]``.

The range leaf describes a contiguous sequence of fuse indexes. It is an array containing two integers: the inclusive lower bound and the exclusive upper bound.

Xpoints leaf
------------

Example: ``{"UIM2_P": 16, "UIM2_N": 17}``.

The crosspoints leaf describes a one-to-one correspondence between networks and fuse offsets. It is an object containing integer fuse offsets where the keys are network names. (This leaf is only used once, to describe product term layout.)

Option leaf
-----------

Example: ``{"fuses": [123, 124], "values": {"high_z": 3, "pull_up": 2, "pull_down": 0}}``.

The option leaf assigns symbolic names to combinations of fuse values, and describes a configurable device feature. It is an object with two keys, ``fuses`` and ``values``.

The ``fuses`` key is an array of fuse indexes that unambiguously maps fuse combinations to integers--the value of first specified fuse is the least significant bit in the binary notation.

The ``values`` key is an object containing symbolic names for known fuse combinations. All names point to unique fuse combiantions, though not every possible fuse combination may have a name assigned to it.

Node ``database``
=================

The root node is a map from device names (e.g. ``ATF1502AS``) to device specifications. The rest of this page is written in the context of a single device specification.

For ``device_name, device`` in ``database``:

Node ``device['pins']``
=======================

This node is a map from packages (e.g. ``TQFP44``) to pinouts.

For ``package, pinout`` in ``device['pins']``:

Mapping ``pinout``
------------------

This mapping relates pads (e.g. ``C2``, ``M1``) to package pins (e.g. ``40``, ``42``).

Mapping ``device['specials']``
==============================

This mapping relates special functions (e.g. ``CLK1``, ``TMS``) to pads (e.g. ``C1``, ``M9``).

Sequence ``block['switches']``

Xpoints ``block['pterm_points']``
---------------------------------

This leaf relates block-local networks to product term fuse offsets. All macrocells in this block share an identical layout of product term fuses. To find a fuse that would include a specific network in a product term, add the index of the first fuse in the product term to the offset corresponding to the network in this leaf.

Node ``device['macrocells']``
=============================

This node is a map from macrocell names (e.g. ``MC1``) to macrocell specifications.

--------------------------------

Reference ``macrocell['pad']``
------------------------------

This reference links the macrocell to the name of the pad connected to the macrocell. The pad connected to a macrocell ``MCx`` is always called ``Mx``; this leaf is provided for convenience.

Node ``macrocell['pterm_ranges']``
----------------------------------

This node is a map from product term names (which are always ``PT1``, ``PT2``, ``PT3``, ``PT4``, ``PT5``) to product term fuse ranges.
